# Human Trafficking on Backpage.com
-----  

This project uses data that was collected over several months using a Raspberry Pi computer to scrape data from backpage.com. The scraper no longer works; either backpage has closed access to their xml files, or they have blocked my IP address.  
  
The concept is simple. The closest thing we have to a unique identifier for women being trafficked on BP is the phone number. By tracking the phone number and connecting it to the city of the ad posting, we can tell when a victim has been moved from one city to another.
